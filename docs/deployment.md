## Verifying BeeGFS CSI Driver Image Signatures

Starting with v1.4.0 of the BeeGFS CSI driver the container images will now be
signed with the use of [Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). The
following steps describe the process you can use to verify trust with the
signing certificate and to validate that the BeeGFS CSI driver images to be
deployed have a valid signature. Verification of the driver's image signatures
is optional.

<a name="manual-image-verification"></a>
### Manual Image Verification

#### Prerequisites: Download the public key and tools

The following tools and files should be available on a Linux host.

  * The [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/releases) utility.
  * The Cosign public key versioned in the repository at
    [release/cosign.pub](../release/cosign.pub).


#### Steps: Validate the BeeGFS CSI Driver image signatures

Identify the image you want to validate. You can validate the image with either
the version tag or the image digest. Starting with v1.5.0 of the BeeGFS CSI
driver the public key used to sign each release will be maintained at
[release/cosign.pub](../release/cosign.pub).

Use the cosign command to validate the signature of the BeeGFS CSI driver
container. Make sure to use the appropriate key file name and tag or digest that
you want to use instead of the placeholders.

OPTION 1: Validate the image using the version tag:

```
cosign verify --key <PUBLIC_KEY_FILE> ghcr.io/thinkparq/beegfs-csi-driver:<TAG>
```
Examples: 
```
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/thinkparq/beegfs-csi-driver:v1.7.0
cosign verify --key https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThinkParQ/beegfs-csi-driver/master/release/cosign.pub ghcr.io/thinkparq/beegfs-csi-driver:v1.7.0
```

OPTION 2: Validate the image using the version tag and digest:

```
cosign verify --key <PUBLIC_KEY_FILE> ghcr.io/thinkparq/beegfs-csi-driver:<TAG>@SHA256:<DIGEST>
```
Examples: 

```
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/thinkparq/beegfs-csi-driver:v1.5.0@SHA256:a6efb4f870003f28a2ee421690f4f9d0e5b8eed0e24b3881fb816a760eb6dfea
cosign verify --key https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThinkParQ/beegfs-csi-driver/master/release/cosign.pub ghcr.io/thinkparq/beegfs-csi-driver:v1.5.0@SHA256:a6efb4f870003f28a2ee421690f4f9d0e5b8eed0e24b3881fb816a760eb6dfea
```

<a name="automating-image-verification"></a>
### Automating Image Verification with Admission Controllers

Kubernetes can be extended to automatically validate container image signatures
through the use of Admission Controllers. The admission controller can be
configured with the public key of a trusted signer and require that deployed
images matching a configured pattern have been signed by that key before the
image is allowed to run. Configuration and use of Admission Controllers is
beyond the scope of this document. For more information see the documentation
for the Admission Controller that you are using.

The following Admission Controllers are known to work with Cosign signatures.

* [Sigstore Policy Controller](https://docs.sigstore.dev/policy-controller/overview/)
* [Connaisseur](https://sse-secure-systems.github.io/connaisseur/)

## Deploying to Kubernetes

<a name="kubernetes-node-preparation"></a>
### Kubernetes Node Preparation

The following MUST be completed on any Kubernetes node (master OR worker) that
runs a component of the driver:
* Download the [BeeGFS repository
  file](https://doc.beegfs.io/latest/advanced_topics/manual_installation.html)
  for your Linux distribution to the appropriate directory.
* Using the package manager for your Linux distribution (i.e. yum, apt, zypper)
  install the following packages: 
  * beegfs-client-dkms
  * beegfs-helperd
  * beegfs-utils
* For BeeGFS versions 7.3.1+ or 7.2.7+, configure the `beegfs-helperd` service
  (in `/etc/beegfs/beegfs-helperd.conf`) with `connDisableAuthentication = true`
  or `connAuthFile = <path to a connAuthFile shared by all file systems>`. See
  [BeeGFS Helperd Configuration](#beegfs-helperd-configuration) for other
  options or more details.
* Start and enable beegfs-helperd using systemd: `systemctl start beegfs-helperd
  && systemctl enable beegfs-helperd`

IMPORTANT: By default the driver uses the beegfs-client.conf file at
*/etc/beegfs/beegfs-client.conf* for base configuration. Modifying the location
of this file is not currently supported without changing kustomization files.

<a name="kubernetes-deployment"></a>
### Kubernetes Deployment

Deployment manifests are provided in this repository under *deploy/k8s/* along with
a default BeeGFS Client ConfigMap. The driver is deployed using `kubectl apply
-k` (kustomize). For more detailed information on how the manifests are organized or 
version specific upgrade information, see the Kubernetes [deployment 
README](../deploy/k8s/README.md).

Steps:
* On a machine with kubectl and access to the Kubernetes cluster where you want
  to deploy the BeeGFS CSI driver clone this repository: `git clone
  https://github.com/ThinkParQ/beegfs-csi-driver.git`.
* Create a new kustomize overlay (changes made to the default overlay will be 
  overwritten in subsequent driver versions): `cp -r deploy/k8s/overlays/default 
  deploy/k8s/overlays/my-overlay`.
* If you wish to modify the default BeeGFS client configuration fill in the
  empty ConfigMap at *deploy/k8s/overlays/my-overlay/csi-beegfs-config.yaml*.
  * An example ConfigMap is provided at
    *deploy/k8s/overlays/examples/csi-beegfs-config.yaml*. Please see the 
    section on [Managing BeeGFS Client
    Configuration](#managing-beegfs-client-configuration) for full details. 
* If you are using [BeeGFS Connection Based Authentication](https://doc.beegfs.io/latest/advanced_topics/authentication.html) 
  fill in the empty Secret config file at 
  *deploy/k8s/overlays/my-overlay/csi-beegfs-connauth.yaml*.
  * An example Secret config file is provided at 
    *deploy/k8s/overlays/examples/csi-beegfs-connauth.yaml*. Please see 
    the section on [ConnAuth Configuration](#connauth-configuration) for full 
    details.
* Enable any desired patches for the BeeGFS CSI driver configuration by
  including a reference to any patch files in the kustomization.yaml file for
  the overlay beng used to deploy the driver.
  * Example patch files can be found in *deploy/k8s/overlays/examples/patches/*
* Change to the BeeGFS CSI driver directory (`cd beegfs-csi-driver`) and run:
  `kubectl apply -k deploy/k8s/overlays/my-overlay`.
  * Note by default the beegfs-csi-driver image will be pulled from
    [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/netapp/beegfs-csi-driver). See [this
    section](#air-gapped-kubernetes-deployment) for guidance deploying in
    offline environments.
  * Note that some supported Kubernetes versions may require modified 
    deployment manifests. Modify the `bases` field in 
    *deploy/k8s/overlays/my-overlay* as necessary before deployment 
    (e.g. `../../versions/v1.18`).
* Verify all components are installed and operational: `kubectl get pods -n
  beegfs-csi`.

Example command outputs: 

```bash
-> kubectl cluster-info
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://some.fqdn.or.ip:6443

-> kubectl apply -k deploy/k8s/overlays/my-overlay
serviceaccount/csi-beegfs-controller-sa created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/csi-beegfs-provisioner-role created

statefulset.apps/csi-beegfs-controller created
daemonset.apps/csi-beegfs-node created
csidriver.storage.k8s.io/beegfs.csi.netapp.com created

-> kubectl get pods -n beegfs-csi
csi-beegfs-controller-0                   2/2     Running   0          2m27s
csi-beegfs-node-2h6ff                     3/3     Running   0          2m27s
csi-beegfs-node-dkcr5                     3/3     Running   0          2m27s
csi-beegfs-node-ntcpc                     3/3     Running   0          2m27s
```
Note the `csi-beegfs-node-#####` pods are part of a DaemonSet, so the number you
see will correspond to the number of Kubernetes worker nodes in your
environment.

Next Steps:
* If you want a quick example on how to get started with the driver see the
  [Example Application Deployment](#example-application-deployment) section. 
* For a comprehensive introduction see the [BeeGFS CSI Driver Usage](usage.md)
  documentation.

<a name="air-gapped-kubernetes-deployment"></a>
### Air-Gapped Kubernetes Deployment

This section provides guidance on deploying the BeeGFS CSI driver in
environments where Kubernetes nodes do not have internet access. 

Deploying the CSI driver involves pulling multiple Docker images from various
Docker registries. You must either ensure all necessary images (see
*deploy/k8s/overlays/default* for a complete list) are 
available on all nodes, or ensure they can be pulled from some internal 
registry.

If your air-gapped environment does not have a Docker Hub mirror, one option is
pulling the necessary images from a machine with access to the internet
(example: `docker pull docker.io/netapp/beegfs-csi-driver`) then save them as
tar files with [docker
save](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save/) so they can be
copied to the air-gapped Kubernetes nodes and loaded with [docker
load](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/load/).

Once the images are available, modify *deploy/k8s/overlays/my-overlay* to point 
to them. Adjust the `images[].newTag` fields as necessary to ensure they either 
match images that exist on the Kubernetes nodes or reference your internal 
registry. Then follow the above commands for Kubernetes deployment.

<a name="mixed-kubernetes-deployment"></a>
### Deployment to Kubernetes Clusters With Mixed Nodes

In some Kubernetes clusters, not all nodes are capable of running the BeeGFS 
CSI driver (or it may not be desirable for all nodes to do so). For example:
* A cluster may be shared by multiple departments and one department may not 
  want the BeeGFS client (and its kernel modules) to be installed on a subset 
  of nodes.
* Some nodes in a cluster may be running an OS that is not supported for the
  BeeGFS client (e.g. a specialized Linux distribution or Red Hat CoreOS in an 
  OpenShift cluster, which currently has [experimental 
  support](../deploy/openshift-beegfs-client/README.md)).
* Some nodes in a cluster may be capable of running the BeeGFS client, but the
  user installing the driver does not have the permissions required to install 
  it.

It is possible to patch the driver's deployment manifest so that the BeeGFS CSI 
driver's controller and node services only run on a subset of nodes. Follow 
these steps:
1. Either identify a label shared by nodes you want to install the driver on or 
   add a label to said nodes. For example:
   * Most Kubernetes distributions include the `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` 
     label on all master nodes.
   * OpenShift clusters include the `node.openshift.io/os_id=rhcos` or 
     `node.openshift.io/os_id=rhel` labels to distinguish between Red Hat 
     CoreOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux nodes.
   * You may want to add a label like `node-role.your.domain/beegfs` to denote 
     BeeGFS capable nodes.
1. Open */deploy/k8s/overlays/my-overlay/patches/node-affinity.yaml* for 
   editing (where "my-overlay") is the overlay you created in 
   [Kubernetes Deployment](#kubernetes-deployment).
1. Edit or uncomment and edit the nodeAffinity field associated with the 
   controller service, the node service, or both. See the [Kubernetes 
   documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes-using-node-affinity/) 
   for more information about nodeAffinity configurations.
1. Deploy the driver: `kubectl apply -k deploy/k8s/overlays/my-overlay`.

NOTE: When the driver is installed in this way, all workloads (e.g. Pods, 
StatefulSets, Deployments) that depend on BeeGFS MUST be deployed with the same 
nodeAffinity assigned to the driver node service. Provide your users with the 
labels or nodes they must run their workloads on.

### Deployment to Kubernetes Using the Operator

An [operator](https://operatorframework.io/what/) can be used to deploy the 
BeeGFS CSI driver to a cluster and manage its configuration/state within that 
cluster. The operator is designed for integration with 
[Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)](https://olm.operatorframework.io/) and is 
primarily intended as an easy way for OpenShift administrators or 
administrators with clusters running OLM to install the driver directly from 
[Operator Hub](https://operatorhub.io/) and keep it updated. It is also 
possible, though not recommended, to install the operator and to use the 
operator to install the driver directly from this repository.

See the [BeeGFS CSI Driver Operator](../operator/README.md) documentation for 
details.

<a name="example-application-deployment"></a>
## Example Application Deployment

Verify that a BeeGFS file system is accessible from the Kubernetes nodes.
Minimally, verify that the BeeGFS servers are up and listening from a
workstation that can access them:

```bash
-> beegfs-check-servers  # -c /path/to/config/file/if/necessary
Management
==========
mgmtd-node [ID: 1]: reachable at mgmtd.some.fdqn.or.ip:8008 (protocol: TCP)

Metadata
==========
meta-node [ID: 1]: reachable at meta.some.fqdn.or.ip:8005 (protocol: TCP)

Storage
==========
storage-node [ID: 1]: reachable at storage.some.fdqn.or.ip:8003 (protocol: TCP)
```

Modify *examples/k8s/dyn/dyn-sc.yaml* such that `parameters`:
- `sysMgmtdHost` is set to an appropriate value (e.g. `mgmtd.some.fqdn.or.ip` in
  the output above)
- `volDirBasePath` contains a k8s cluster `name` that is unique to this k8s
  cluster among all k8s clusters accessing this BeeGFS file system.

From the project directory, deploy the application files found in the
*examples/k8s/dyn/* directory, including a Storage Class, a PVC, and a pod which
mounts a volume using the BeeGFS CSI driver:

```bash
-> kubectl apply -f examples/k8s/dyn
storageclass.storage.k8s.io/csi-beegfs-dyn-sc created
persistentvolumeclaim/csi-beegfs-dyn-pvc created
pod/csi-beegfs-dyn-app created
```

Validate that the components deployed successfully:

```shell
-> kubectl get sc csi-beegfs-dyn-sc
NAME                PROVISIONER             RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE   ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE

csi-beegfs-dyn-app   1/1     Running   0          93s
```

Finally, inspect the application pod `csi-beegfs-dyn-app` which mounts a BeeGFS
volume:

```bash
-> kubectl describe pod csi-beegfs-dyn-app

```

`csi-beegfs-dyn-app` is configured to create a file inside its own */mnt/dyn*
directory called *touched-by-<pod_uuid>*. Confirm that this file exists within
the pod:

```bash
-> kubectl exec csi-beegfs-dyn-app -- ls /mnt/dyn
touched-by-9154aace-65a3-495d-8266-38eb0b564ddd
``` 

Kubernetes stages the BeeGFS file system in the */var/lib/kubelet/plugins*
directory and publishes the specific directory associated with the persistent
volume to the pod in the */var/lib/kubelet/pods* directory. Verify that the
touched file exists in these locations if you have appropriate access to the
worker node:

```bash
-> ssh root@10.193.161.165
-> ls /var/lib/kubelet/plugins/kubernetes.io/csi/pv/pvc-7621fab2/globalmount/mount/k8s/my-cluster-name/pvc-7621fab2/
touched-by-9154aace-65a3-495d-8266-38eb0b564ddd

touched-by-9154aace-65a3-495d-8266-38eb0b564ddd
```

Finally, verify that the file exists on the BeeGFS file system from a
workstation that can access it.

```bash
ls /mnt/beegfs/k8s/my-cluster-name/pvc-7621fab2/
touched-by-9154aace-65a3-495d-8266-38eb0b564ddd
```

## Managing BeeGFS Client Configuration

Currently the only tested and supported container orchestrator (CO) for the
BeeGFS CSI driver is Kubernetes. Notes in the General Configuration section
below would apply to other COs if supported. For Kubernetes the preferred method
to apply desired BeeGFS Client configuration is using a Kubernetes ConfigMap and
Secret, as described in [Kubernetes Configuration](#kubernetes-configuration).

<a name="general-configuration"></a>
### General Configuration

The driver is ready to be used right out of the box, but many environments may
either require or benefit from additional configuration.

The driver loads a configuration file on startup which it uses as a template to
create the necessary configuration files to properly mount a BeeGFS file system.
A beegfs-client.conf file does NOT ship with the driver, so it applies the
values defined in its configuration file on top of the default
beegfs-client.conf that ships with each BeeGFS distribution. Each `config`
section may optionally contain parameters that override previous sections.

Depending on the topology of your cluster, some nodes MAY need different
configuration than others. This requirement can be handled in one of two ways:
1. The administrator creates unique configuration files and deploys each to the
   proper node.
2. The administrator creates one global configuration file with a
   `nodeSpecificConfigs` section and specifies the `--node-id` CLI flag on each
   node when starting the driver.
     * Note: Deploying to Kubernetes using the provided manifests in deploy/k8s/
       handles setting this flag and deploying a ConfigMap representing this
       global configuration file.  

Kubernetes deployment greatly simplifies the distribution of a global
configuration file using the second approach and is the de-facto standard way to
deploy the driver. See [Kubernetes Configuration](#kubernetes-configuration) for
details.

In the example below, the `beegfsClientConf` section contains parameters taken
directly out of a beegfs-client.conf configuration file. In particular, the
beegfs-client.conf file contains a number of references to other files (e.g.
`connInterfacesFile`). The CSI configuration file instead expects a YAML list,
which it uses to generate the expected file. See [BeeGFS Client
Parameters](#beegfs-client-parameters) for more detail about
supported `beegfsClientConf` parameters.

NOTE: beegfs-client.conf values MUST be specified as strings, even if they 
appear to be integers or booleans (e.g. "8000", not 8000 and "true", not true).

The order of precedence for configuration option overrides is described by
"PRECEDENCE" comments in the example below. In general, precedence is as
follows: 

>config < fileSystemSpecificConfig < nodeSpecificConfig.config <
nodeSpecificConfig.fileSystemSpecificConfig 

When conflicts occur between configurations of equal precedence, configuration
set lower in the file takes precedence over configuration set higher in the
file.

NOTE: All configuration, and in particular `fileSystemSpecificConfigs` and
`nodeSpecificConfigs` configuration is OPTIONAL! In many situations, only the
outermost `config` is required.

```yaml
# when more specific configuration is not provided; PRECEDENCE 3 (lowest)
config:  # OPTIONAL
  connInterfaces:
    - <interface_name>  # e.g. ib0
    - <interface_name>
  connNetFilter:
    - <ip_subnet>  # e.g. 10.0.0.1/24
    - <ip_subnet>
  connTcpOnlyFilter:
    - <ip_subnet>  # e.g. 10.0.0.1/24
    - <ip_subnet>
  connRDMAInterfaces:
    - <interface_name>  # e.g. ib0
    - <interface_name>
  beegfsClientConf:
    <beegfs-client.conf_key>: <beegfs-client.conf_value>
    # All beegfs-client.conf values must be strings. Quotes are required on 
    # integers and booleans.
    # e.g. connMgmtdPortTCP: "9008"
    # SEE BELOW FOR RESTRICTIONS

fileSystemSpecificConfigs:  # OPTIONAL
    # for a specific filesystem; PRECEDENCE 2
  - sysMgmtdHost: <sysMgmtdHost>  # e.g. 10.10.10.1
    config:  # as above

    # for a specific filesystem; PRECEDENCE 2
  - sysMgmtdHost: <sysMgmtdHost>  # e.g. 10.10.10.100
    config:  # as above

nodeSpecificConfigs:  # OPTIONAL
  - nodeList:
      - <node_name>  # e.g. node1
      - <node_name>
    # default for a specific set of nodes; PRECEDENCE 1
    config:  # as above:
    # for a specific node AND filesystem; PRECEDENCE 0 (highest)
    fileSystemSpecificConfigs:  # as above

  - nodeList:
      - <node_name>  # e.g. node1
      - <node_name>
    # default for a specific set of nodes; PRECEDENCE 1
    config:  # as above:
    # for a specific node AND filesystem; PRECEDENCE 0 (highest)
    fileSystemSpecificConfigs:  # as above
```

NOTE: When running the driver directly, the configuration file is specified by
the `--config-path` command line argument. For Kubernetes, the deployment
manifests handle this automatically.

<a name="connauth-configuration"></a>
#### ConnAuth Configuration

As of BeeGFS `v7.3.1+` and `v7.2.7+`, connection based authentication is enabled by default unless
explicitly disabled. See the [BeeGFS
docs](https://doc.beegfs.io/latest/advanced_topics/authentication.html) for more details. When using
raw string secrets, the driver will function as previously expected. Care should be taken when
creating raw string secrets as different text editors behave differently. Specifically, some editors
add newlines to the end of files. This may produce mis-match connAuthFile secrets between the client
and BeeGFS services causing the driver to fail.

With version `v1.5.0` the CSI driver added support for base64 encoded connAuthFile secrets. See
[Base64 Encoded Secrets](#base64-encoded-secrets) for more details. To ensure your secret is
correct, it is recommended to use base64 encoded secrets.

NOTE: Utilizing raw string secrets does not require an `encoding` field, but can
be explicitly set using `encoding: raw`.

##### Option 1: Use Connection Authentication

For security purposes, the contents of BeeGFS connAuthFiles are stored in a
separate file. This file is optional, and should only be used if the
connAuthFile configuration option is used on a file system's other services.

```yaml
- sysMgmtdHost: <sysMgmtdHost>  # e.g. 10.10.10.1
  connAuth: <some_secret_value>
  encoding: <encoding_type> # raw or base64
- sysMgmtdHost: <sysMgmtdHost>  # e.g. 10.10.10.100
  connAuth: <some_secret_value>
  encoding: <encoding_type> # raw or base64
```

NOTES:
* Unlike general configuration, connAuth configuration is only applied at a 
per file system level. There is no default connAuth and the concept of a node 
specific connAuth doesn't make sense.
* When running the driver directly, the connAuth configuration file is
specified by the `--connauth-path` command line argument. For Kubernetes, the
deployment manifests handle this automatically.
* It is also possible to create a connAuthFile and set the connAuthFile
parameter in the default beegfs-client.conf file on every node. This option
makes the most sense if also [configuring
beegfs-helperd](#beegfs-helperd-configuration) to use connection authentication,
as this requires per-node configuration of beegfs-helperd.conf.

<a name="base64-encoded-secrets"></a>
Using Base64 Encoded Secrets:

It is recommended to use binary connAuthFile secrets utilizing base64 encoding
as this aligns with
[BeeGFS's](https://doc.beegfs.io/latest/advanced_topics/authentication.html?highlight=authentication)
recommended format. The following are steps to implement base64 encoded secrets.

1. Follow the 
[BeeGFS Authentication](https://doc.beegfs.io/latest/advanced_topics/authentication.html?highlight=authentication)
steps to create a connAuthFile that contains a binary secret.

1. Once created, navigate to the location of your connAuthFile and encode the 
file utilizing base64 encoding.
```
-> cd /etc/beegfs/
-> base64 connAuthFile 
DbQqb8py78SrmHfpLBR1E0/eEJ5kQBXy9wPtY7umL46s3X0ILlrTednZQOMb+/9/gBIxFqNpyzOn
tHyiNQNMEVNjXsihw11S5G4UbFw3Olcx8ehhnGTjWo0OoGKqM0TEL2FR8p3t1An0l1LUwYj1lrIG
PQ== 
```
3. Copy and paste the output into `csi-beegfs-connauth.yaml`.
Include the `encoding: base64` key-value pair inside `csi-beegfs-connauth.yaml` to 
ensure decoding of your secret. The `csi-beegfs-connauth.yaml` should look similar to the following.

  ```yaml
  # Copyright 2021 NetApp, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
  # Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

  # Use this file as instructed in the ConnAuth Configuration section of /docs/deployment.md. See
  # /deploy/k8s/examples/csi-beegfs-connauth.yaml for an example of what to put in this file. Kustomize will
  # automatically transform this file into a correct Secret readable by the deployed driver. If this file is left
  # unmodified, the driver will deploy correctly with no custom configuration.

  - sysMgmtdHost: 10.10.10.10
    connAuth: |+
      DbQqb8py78SrmHfpLBR1E0/eEJ5kQBXy9wPtY7umL46s3X0ILlrTednZQOMb+/9/gBIxFqNpyzOn
      tHyiNQNMEVNjXsihw11S5G4UbFw3Olcx8ehhnGTjWo0OoGKqM0TEL2FR8p3t1An0l1LUwYj1lrIG
      PQ==
    encoding: base64
  ```

##### Option 2: Disable Connection Authentication

Only if you are using BeeGFS v7.3.1+ or v7.2.7+ and do not want to use
connection authentication, you must explicitly disable it by setting the
following.

```yaml
config:
  beegfsClientConf:
    connDisableAuthentication: "true"
```

NOTE: This parameter does not exist in previous BeeGFS versions and BeeGFS will 
fail to mount if it is provided for a file system that does not support it.

<a name="beegfs-helperd-configuration"></a>
#### BeeGFS Helperd Configuration

The [BeeGFS Helperd 
service](https://doc.beegfs.io/latest/advanced_topics/client_compat.html?highlight=helperd#helperd) 
is used by the BeeGFS client kernel module for DNS resolution and logging. 
BeeGFS can run without it, but this is not a typical configuration.

Previously, it was common to run beegfs-helperd without a connAuthFile on all
nodes that were to host the BeeGFS CSI driver. This allowed the driver to mount
different file systems (with different connAuthFiles) simultaneously.
Connections between the client and the (usually local) beegfs-helperd service
were not authenticated, but connections between the client and and other file
system services were authenticated per the driver's [connAuth
configuration](#connauth-configuration).

As of BeeGFS v7.3.1+ and v7.2.7+, BeeGFS requires a connAuthFile to be used by 
all services (including beegfs-helperd) or for authentication to be explicitly 
disabled in each service. The BeeGFS CSI driver is not able to modify the 
configuration of the beegfs-helperd service, so care must be taken to configure 
it appropriately as a prerequisite. 

Recommended options:

* Set `connDisableAuthentication = true` in `/etc/beegfs/beegfs-helperd.conf`
  before starting and enabling beegfs-helperd on each node. This disables
  authentication between the BeeGFS client and beegfs-helpderd, but does not
  disable authentication between the client and other file system services. It 
  allows the client to interact with beegfs-helperd regardless of whether or not
  the file system it is mounting uses a connAuthFile.
* On each node, pre-populate a connAuthFile (e.g. `/etc/beegfs/connAuthFile`)
  with a shared secret that will be used by all BeeGFS file systems the driver
  will mount. Set `connAuthFile` in both `/etc/beegfs/beegfs-helperd.conf` and
  `/etc/beegfs/beegfs-client.conf`. Start and enable beegfs-helperd. Do not use
  the [connAuth configuration mechanisms](#connauth-configuration) built into
  the driver. It is not possible to use different connAuth secrets for different
  file systems with this approach.

Non-recommended options:

* Run without beegfs-helperd by setting `logType: syslog` and
  `sysMountSanityCheckMS: 0` either in the driver configuration or in
  `/etc/beegfs/beegfs-client.conf` on all nodes (see more detailed instructions
  on the [BeeGFS docs
  site](https://doc.beegfs.io/latest/advanced_topics/client_compat.html?highlight=helperd#running-without-helperd)).
  This approach routes logs through syslog (so that they appear in the same
  location as other service logs instead of more "standard" BeeGFS locations)
  and prevents the use of DNS names with BeeGFS services. It also disables the
  BeeGFS mount sanity check, allowing mounts to "succeed" even when critical
  BeeGFS services cannot be reached.

<a name="kubernetes-configuration"></a>
### Kubernetes Configuration

When deployed into Kubernetes, a single Kubernetes ConfigMap contains the
configuration for all Kubernetes nodes. When the driver starts up on a node, it
uses the node's name to filter the global ConfigMap down to a node-specific
version. 

The instructions in the [Kubernetes Deployment](#kubernetes-deployment)
automatically create an empty ConfigMap and an empty Secret and pass them to the
driver on all nodes.

* To pass custom configuration to the driver, add the desired parameters from
[General Configuration](#general-configuration) to
  *deploy/k8s/overlays/my-overlay/csi-beegfs-config.yaml* before deploying. 
  The resulting deployment will automatically include a correctly formed 
  ConfigMap. See *deploy/k8s/overlays/examples/csi-beegfs-config.yaml* for an 
  example file.
* To pass connAuth configuration to the driver, modify
  *deploy/k8s/overlays/my-overlay/csi-beegfs-connauth.yaml* before deploying. 
  The resulting deployment will automatically include a correctly formed
  Secret. See *deploy/k8s/overlays/examples/beegfs-config-connauth.yaml* for an 
  example file.

To update configuration after initial deployment, modify
*deploy/k8s/overlays/my-overlay/csi-beegfs-config.yaml* or 
*deploy/k8s/overlays/my-overlay/csi-beegfs-connauth.yaml* and repeat the 
kubectl deployment step from [Kubernetes Deployment](#kubernetes-deployment). 
Kustomize will automatically update all components and restart the driver on 
all nodes so that it picks up the latest changes.

NOTE: To validate the BeeGFS Client configuration file used for a specific PVC,

<a name="beegfs-client-parameters"></a>
### BeeGFS Client Parameters (beegfsClientConf)

The following beegfs-client.conf parameters appear in the BeeGFS v7.3.1
[beegfs-client.conf
file](https://git.beegfs.io/pub/v7/-/blob/7.3.1/client_module/build/dist/etc/beegfs-client.conf).
Other parameters may exist for newer or older BeeGFS versions. The list a
parameter falls under determines its level of support in the driver.

<a name="notable"></a>
#### Notable

Special attention should be paid to these parameters.

* `connDisableAuthentication` - Added in BeeGFS v7.3.1 and BeeGFS v7.2.7. If the file system the
  BeeGFS client will connect to does not use connAuth files, this must be set to `"true"`.
  * Note: To avoid YAML interpeting the value as a native boolean, it must be enclosed in double
    quotes or you will get an error like:
    
    ```
    failed to handle configuration file: likely missing quotes around an integer or boolean beegfsClientConf value: error unmarshaling JSON: while decoding JSON: json: cannot unmarshal bool into Go struct field BeegfsConfig.config.beegfsClientConf of type string`
    ```

<a name="no-effect"></a>
#### No Effect

These parameters are specified elsewhere (a Kubernetes StorageClass, etc.) or
are determined dynamically and have no effect when specified in the
`beeGFSClientConf` configuration section.

* `sysMgmtdHost` (This is specified in a `fileSystemSpecificConfigs[i]` or by
  the volume definition itself.)
* `connClientPortUDP` (An ephemeral port, obtained by binding to port 0, allows
  multiple filesystem mounts. On Linux the selected ephemeral port is
  constrained by the values of [IP
  variables](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/networking/ip-sysctl.html#ip-variables).
  [Ensure that firewalls allow UDP
  traffic](https://doc.beegfs.io/latest/advanced_topics/network_tuning.html#firewalls-network-address-translation-nat)
  between BeeGFS file system nodes and ephemeral ports on BeeGFS CSI Driver
  nodes.)
* `connPortShift`

<a name="unsupported"></a>
#### Unsupported

These parameters are specified elsewhere and may exhibit undocumented behavior
if specified here.

* `connAuthFile` - Overridden in the 
  [connAuth configuration file](#connauth-configuration).
* `connInterfacesFile` - Overridden by lists in the 
  [driver configuration file](#general-configuration).
* `connRDMAInterfacesFile` - Overriden by lists in the driver configuration
  file.
* `connNetFilterFile` - Overridden by lists in the driver configuration file.
* `connTcpOnlyFilterFile` - Overridden by lists in the driver configuration 
  file.

<a name="tested"></a>
#### Tested

## Notes for Kubernetes Administrators

<a name="security-considerations"></a>
### Security and Networking Considerations

**The driver must be allowed to mount and unmount file systems.**

* When the driver binary is run directly, it must be run as a user with
  permission to make the mount and unmount system calls and with permission to
  create and delete directories on the staging target path and target path.
* When the driver is run in its container, the container must be granted the
  CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability or the container must be privileged. The provided
  Kubernetes deployment manifests run the driver container as privileged to
  avoid SELinux and other concerns.

**The driver must be allowed to reserve arbitrary UDP ports in the primary
network namespace.**

For each volume to be mounted on a node, the driver identifies an
available UDP port. Mounting the volume causes the BeeGFS client to listen for
UDP traffic on this port. While the driver may be running in a container, the
BeeGFS client is not. The provided Kubernetes deployment manifests run the
driver container in the host network instead of an isolated container network
to allow the driver to correctly identify available ports.

**The network must allow BeeGFS traffic.**

[By default](https://doc.beegfs.io/latest/advanced_topics/network_tuning.html#firewalls-network-address-translation-nat),
outbound traffic from all BeeGFS clients to ports 8003, 8005, and 8008 on nodes
serving up BeeGFS file systems must be allowed. A BeeGFS file system can be
configured to use different ports and the driver [can be
configured](#general-configuration) to accomodate.

Inbound UDP traffic from nodes serving up BeeGFS file systems to arbitrary
ports on all BeeGFS clients must be allowed. Each volume requires its own port
and it is not currently possible to configure an allowed port range.

**Appropriate roles should be enforced.**

It is important to consider the roles different users can assume when
interacting with the BeeGFs CSI driver. The driver (like all CSI drivers) does
not, itself, authenticate or authorize users. However, different Kubernetes
users naturally have a greater or lesser ability to interact with it. The
driver's security model generally assumes two types of users:
1. Administrators:
   - Have the ability to interact with the driver's namespace
     (`beegfs-csi` by default). 
   - Can modify the driver's deployment manifests and configuration files
     (`csi-beegfs-config.yaml` and `csi-beegfs-connauth.yaml`).
   - Can create/modify Storage Classes and Persistent Volumes.
   - Can optionally create/modify Persistent Volume Claims referencing a 
     Storage Class or Persistent Volume.
1. Users:
   - Cannot interact with the driver's namespace.
   - Can create and modify objects in a limited number of other namespaces.
   - Can create/modify Persistent Volume Claims referencing a Storage Class or 
     Persistent Volume.

A Kubernetes user's ability to assume one of these two roles is entirely
dependent on the configuration of the underlying Kubernetes cluster. A user with
an inappropriate level of permissions can cause any number of problems in a
cluster. The following issues are specific to the BeeGFS CSI driver.

With the ability to create or modify objects in the driver namespace (e.g. the 
driver's Stateful Set / Daemon Set, csi-beegfs-config.yaml, etc.), a user can:
- Misconfigure the driver (potentially resulting in poor performance and/or 
  limited denial of service).

With the ability to create or modify Storage Classes or Persistent Volumes, a 
user can: 
- Cause a BeeGFS file system to mount or a BeeGFS directory to bind mount with 
  arbitrary mount options (potentially resulting in poor performance and/or 
  limited denial of service). 
- Provide access to arbitrary files and directories within a BeeGFS file system 
  (although [permissions based protections](usage.md/permissions) still apply).

**SELinux**

[SELinux](https://selinuxproject.org/page/Main_Page) is a security enhancement to Linux which allows users and
administrators fine-grained access control. With SELinux enabled, every process and file is assigned a security context.
Typically, default SELinux policies provided by a Linux distribution's maintainers determine how each process context
can interact with each file context (though these policies may be modified as needed). Files are typically automatically
"labeled" with a context at creation, and each file's label is stored in its extended attributes.

Though BeeGFS does support extended attributes, it [does not officially support SELinux
labeling](https://doc.beegfs.io/latest/trouble_shooting/general.html#access-denied-error-on-the-client-even-with-correct-permissions)
and it is not currently possible to assign labels to BeeGFS files and directories. By default, all BeeGFS files and
directories on an SELinux system are treated as if they have the system_u:object_r:unlabeled_t:s0 security context.
Privileged containers (which typically run with the system_u:system_r:spc_t:s0 context) can access them, but standard
containers (which typically run with the system_u:system_r:container_t:s0 context) cannot.

By default, when SELinux is enabled, the BeeGFS CSI driver mounts all file systems using the `-o
context=system_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0` option. This causes SELinux to treat all BeeGFS files and directories as
if they have this same, single context and allows typical containers to read, write and execute BeeGFS files (within the
bounds of file access permissions). While this is not full SELinux support, it allows administrators to leave SELinux
enabled and helps to prevent the exploitation of container runtime vulnerabilities.

<a name="resource-and-performance-considerations"></a>
### Resource and Performance Considerations

<a name="limit-in-flight-requests"></a>
#### Limit the number of in-flight requests.

The controller service responds to CreateVolume and DeleteVolume requests made by the [external-provisioner sidecar
container](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-provisioner) deployed alongside it. (The sidecar handles all
communication with the Kubernetes API server.) The external-provisioner application accepts a --worker-threads argument,
which can be used to [effectively
limit](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-provisioner#csi-error-and-timeout-handling) the in-flight number of
these types of requests. Each CreateVolume request MAY cause the controller service to mount the associated BeeGFS
filesystem, and each DeleteVolume request DOES cause the controller service to mount the associated BeeGFS filesystem,
so there is a reasonable concern that too many such simultaneous operations could be problematic.

Limited stress testing has found that no issues occur with 200 simultaneous Persistent Volume Claim creations or with
200 simultaneous Persistent Volume Claim deletions, so the --worker-threads argument does not appear in the default
manifests. Add it as an argument to the `csi-provisioner` Container in the `csi-beegfs-controller` Stateful Set
definition if an issue is observed. See the [Kubernetes deployment README.md](../deploy/k8s/README.md) for instructions.

<a name="managing-requests-and-limits"></a>
#### Managing CPU and Memory Requests and Limits

Starting in v1.4.0 of the BeeGFS CSI driver the driver containers are now
configured with default requests and limits for both cpu and memory resources.
The default values should work for most scenarios but the values can be adjusted
as necessary for a particular deployment.

The recommended way to change the value of a cpu or memory request or limit is
to use a patch to modify the settings during the deployment with kustomize. The
default overlay directories have a `container-resources.yaml` file included in
the overlay's patch directory which contains the default resource values. Simply
modify the file in your copied version of the overlay directory and uncomment
(or add) the reference to the `patches/container-resource.yaml` file in the
patchesStrategicMerge section of your overlay's kustomization.yaml file. Once
the patch file is referenced in the overlay kustomization file then apply the
overlay to deploy the driver or to update the existing deployment's
configuration.

<a name="removing-the-driver-from-kubernetes"></a>
## Removing the Driver from Kubernetes

If you're experiencing any issues, find functionality lacking, or our
documentation is unclear, we'd appreciate if you let us know:
https://github.com/ThinkParQ/beegfs-csi-driver/issues. 

The driver can be removed using `kubectl delete -k` (kustomize) and the original
deployment manifests. On a machine with kubectl and access to the Kubernetes
cluster you want to remove the BeeGFS CSI driver from: 

* Remove any Storage Classes, Persistent Volumes, and Persistent Volume Claims
  associated with the driver. 
* Set the working directory to the beegfs-csi-driver repository containing the
  manifests used to deploy the driver.
* Run the following command to remove the driver: `kubectl delete -k
  deploy/k8s/overlays/my-overlay`
