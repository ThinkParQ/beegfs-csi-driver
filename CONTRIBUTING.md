# ThinkParQ Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before contributions can be accepted we must have a signed CLA on file for all contributor(s):

* Download and fill out and sign the ThinkParQ CLA found at:
  https://www.beegfs.io/docs/ThinkParQ_CLA.pdf.
* Email your signed copy to <info@thinkparq.com>.

 # Creating a Pull Request

1. Please search [existing issues](https://github.com/ThinkParQ/beegfs-csi-driver/issues) to determine if an
   issue already exists for what you intend to contribute.
2. If the issue does not exist, [create a new
   one](https://github.com/ThinkParQ/beegfs-csi-driver/issues/new) that explains the bug or feature request.
   * Let us know in the issue that you plan on creating a pull request for it. This helps us to keep
     track of the pull request and avoid any duplicate efforts.
3. Before creating a pull request, write up a brief proposal in the issue describing what your
   change would be and how it would work so that others can comment.
    * It's better to wait for feedback from the maintainers before writing code. We don't have an
      SLA for our feedback, but we will do our best to respond in a timely manner (at a minimum, to
      give you an idea if you're on the right track and that you should proceed, or not).
4. While making your changes ensure they comply with the project's [coding
   standards](https://github.com/ThinkParQ/beegfs-go/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Go#coding-standards).
5. When ready refer to the guidelines and process for submitting a [Pull
   Request](https://github.com/ThinkParQ/beegfs-go/wiki/Pull-Requests).
   

# Our Commitment
While we truly appreciate your efforts on pull requests and will accept contributions as often as we
can, we **cannot** commit to accepting all PRs. Here are a few reasons why a PR may be rejected:

* There are many factors involved in integrating new code into this project including:
  * Adding appropriate unit and end-to-end test coverage for new/changed functionality. 
  * Ensuring adherence with ThinkParQ and industry standards around security and licensing. 
  * Validating new functionality doesn't raise long-term maintainability and/or supportability
    concerns.    
  * Verifying changes fit with the current and/or planned architecture. 
  * etc. 

  In other words, while your bug fix or feature may be perfect as a standalone patch, we have to
  ensure the changes also work in all use cases, supported, configurations, and across our support
  matrix.

* The BeeGFS development team must plan resources to integrate your code into our code base and CI
  platform, and depending on the complexity of your PR, we may or may not have the resources
  available to make it happen in a timely fashion. We'll do our best, but typically the earliest
  changes can be merged into the master branch is with our next formal release, unless they resolve
  a critical bug or security vulnerability. 

* Sometimes a PR doesn't fit into our future plans or conflicts with other items on the roadmap.
  It's possible that a PR you submit doesn't align with our upcoming plans, thus we won't be able to
  use it. It's not personal and why we highly recommend submitting an issue with your proposed
  changes so we can provide feedback before you expend significant effort on development. 

Thank you for considering to contribute to the BeeGFS CSI driver project.
