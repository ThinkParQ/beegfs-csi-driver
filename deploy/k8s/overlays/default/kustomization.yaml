# The images section is used to transform the image name to specify the specific image to use in the deployment
# manifests. This section can be used to adjust the registry and image names and tags for air-gapped environments
# or other scenarios where custom containers names are used. You can adjust the registry and/or location within
# a registry with the newName field. You can change the tag being used with the NewTag field. You can also
# use an image digest with the digest field.
# See https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/builtins/#_imagetagtransformer_
# for more information on how to use this section.
